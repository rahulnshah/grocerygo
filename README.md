# shoppingList
## What is it?
A simple GUI application that not only allows one to add, update, and remove a shopping item in a shopping list, but allows one email it to its recipient.

## The steps:
1. Set up 2-Step Verfication on your Google account, because Gmail does not allow Python access to your emails. You will later need to also set a password for Python in your Google account settings, so that you can access your Gmail from Python and direct emails from Python.
2. Put your email address as the first argument of () in emailInPython.py and Python's unique 16-character password-excluding spaces-as its second argument.
3. Navigate to the directory where my cloned repository will be on your computer.
4. Run this command: ```python shopping_list_oop.py```
