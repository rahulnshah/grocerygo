# shoppingList  (portfolio project)
## What is it?
User-friendly Tkinter GUI for managing a shopping list.

## How to Use it:
1. Set up 2-Step Verfication on your Google account, because Gmail does not allow Python access to your emails. You will later need to also set an app password for Python in your Google account settings, so that you can give Python access to your Gmail and direct your emails from Python.
2. Put your email address as the first argument of ```email_content``` in ```emailInPython.py``` and your unique 16-character app Python password-excluding spaces-as its second argument.
3. Navigate to the directory where my cloned repository will be on your computer.
4. Run this command: ```python shopping_list_oop.py``` 
5. You should see this pop up:
